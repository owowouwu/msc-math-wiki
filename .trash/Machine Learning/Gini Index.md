## Definition

Calculates the amount of probability of a specific feature that is classified incorrectly when selected randomly.

For a given feature $i$, the Gini index is

$G_i = \sum_{k} p_{ik}(1-p_{ik})$

the first term represents the probability a random entry belongs to class $i$, while the second is the probability it is misclassified.
