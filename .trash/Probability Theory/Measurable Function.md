A measurable function is a function between two measurable spaces  such that the preimage is also measurable. 

## Definition

Let $(X, \Sigma)$, $(Y, T)$ be two measurable spaces. $f : X\rightarrow Y$ is measurable if for any $S \in T$,

$f^{-1}(S) = \{x \in X | f(x) \in S\} \in T$

that is, the pre-image of $S$ under $f$ is in $T$, that is it is a measurable set of $Y$.

Most real functions are measurable under the Borel sigma algebra.
