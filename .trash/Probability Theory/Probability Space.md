A probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ consists of three elements -

1. The *sample space* $\Omega$
2. The set of *events* $\mathcal{F}$
3. A probability function which assigns each event a probability.

$P : \mathcal{F} \rightarrow [0,1]$ is a [[Measure|measure]] with the following properties -

1. $P(\omega) = 1$
2. Satisfies countable additivity.
