Can be thought of as a function of the outcomes of a random experiment represented in a [[Probability Space | probability space]]. 

## Definition

A random variable $X$ is a [[Measurable Function | measurable function]] $X : (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \rightarrow (X, \Sigma)$, i.e from a set of outcomes $\Omega$ to a measurable space $X$.

Usually we take $X : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is equipped with the [[Borel Sigma Algebra]]. In such a case, it suffices to show that

$$ {\omega : X(\omega) \leq t} $$

is an event (i.e in $\mathcal{F}$) for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$.
