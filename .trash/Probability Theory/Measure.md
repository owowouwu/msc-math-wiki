The theory of applying an abstract notion of mass/size/volume to sets.

## Definition

Let $X$ be a set and $\Sigma$ be a [[Sigma Algebra]] over $X$. A function $\mu$ from $\Sigma$ to the [[Extended Reals]] is a function which satsifies -

1. *Non-negativity* $\mu(A) \geq 0$ for all $A \in \Sigma$
2. $\mu(\phi) = 0$
3. *Countable additivity* $\mu(\bigcup A_n) = \sum \mu(A_n)$

The triple $(X, \Sigma, \mu)$ is called a measure space.
