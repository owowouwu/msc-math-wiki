Idea - find a way to represent some domain object mathematically/computationally. 

e.g image vectors, text vectors

Often done by using [[Neural Networks]] as these networks can learn a feature hierarchy which allows for complex features to be created (embeddings).

Embeddings are low dimensional representations of the input.
