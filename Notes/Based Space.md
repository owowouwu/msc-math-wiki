# Definition

A **based space** $(X, x_{0})$ is a [[Topological Space]] $(X, \mathcal{T}_{X})$ with a point $x_{0} \in X$ called the **base point**.

The space of **based** maps is
$$
\mathrm{Map}((X, x_{0}), (Y, y_{0})) = \left\{ f: X \to Y : f \text{ continuous and } f(x_{0}) = y_{0} \right\} 
$$
