A $\pi$-system is a family of $\mathcal{P}$ subsets of some larger set $\Omega$ that is non-empty and closed under finite intersection -
$$
A, B \in \mathcal{P} \implies A \cap B \in \mathcal{P} 
$$

## important property

If two probability measures agree on a $\pi$-system, they agree on the [[Sigma Algebra]] generated by that $\pi$-system.
