# Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_{X})$ be a [[Topological Space]] and $a_{1}, a_{2}, \dots$ be a sequence in $X$. A **limit point** is $z \in X$ such that for any $N \in \mathcal{N}(z)$ there exists $l \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ such that $\left\{ a_{l}, a_{l+1},\dots \right\} \subseteq N$ 

Note that under this definition limit points of a sequence in $X$ are not necessarily unique but depend on the topology on $X$.
