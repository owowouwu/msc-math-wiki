# Definition (Topology)

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_{X})$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_{Y})$ be [[Topological Space|topological spaces]]. Suppose $f: X \to Y$ is a function. We say that $f$ is continuous at a point $a \in X$ if

For any $V \in \mathcal{N}(f(a))$ we have that
$$
f^{-1}(V) \in \mathcal{N}(a)
$$
in other words, if $V$ is a [[Neighbourhood]] of $f(a)$ then the preimage of $V$ is a [[Neighbourhood]] of $a$.
