# Motivating Convergence of Random Variables


# Tail Events

Often times we can use this notion to make our intuition more rigorous or take shortcuts in problems.

For example, the event
$$
A = \left\{ \sup_{k \geq n} X_{k}  > 1\right\} 
$$
is a tail event because it is independent of some discarded terms.

# [[Kolmogorov's Zero One Laws]]

This is a strong result about tail events that says that we either have 0 or 1 probability for tail events.
