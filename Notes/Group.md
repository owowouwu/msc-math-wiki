# Definition

A group is a set $X$ equipped with a binary operation $\cdot$ such that this operation is -

1. Associative
2. Has an identity element, i.e there exists $e \in X$ with $x \cdot e = e \cdot x = x$.
3. Has an inverse element, i.e for any $a \in X$ there exists $b \in X$ such that $a \cdot b = b \cdot a = e$.

## Examples

Integers are a group with addition
