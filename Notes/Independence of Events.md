# Definition

Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a [[Probability Space]]. Two events $A, B \in \mathcal{F}$ are **independent** if
$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)
$$
## Equivalent Characterisations

### Random Variables

Using [[Independent Random Variables]], two events are independent if their **indicator functions** $1_{A}(\omega), 1_{B}(\omega)$ are independent.

### Sigma Algebras

Using [[Independence of Sigma Algebras]], two events are independent if and only if their generated [[Sigma Algebra]] are independent, i.e $\sigma(A)$ is independent to $\sigma(B)$.
