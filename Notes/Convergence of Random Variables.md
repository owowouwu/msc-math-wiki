## [[Convergence Almost Surely]]

The intuition here is that we know looking for sure that our sequence will eventually converge, we just don't know when. Taking a sample path $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3},\dots$ and so on, we know for sure that this sample path becomes $x$ at one point, and stays at $x$.

## [[Convergence in Probability]]

The main difference between converging in probability and almost surely is that we don't know for sure that our sequence converges to a target, we know in many sample paths $x_{1},x_{2},\dots$ it will converge to $x$, but there is a possibility it might not in some sample paths. In other words, convergence in probability simple means that for large enough $n$, the probability that $x_{n}\neq x$ is very small.
 
## [[Weak Convergence]]

This only looks at the distribution function. In fact it does not make sense to compare almost sure convergence and weak convergence because the former only makes sense if we are talking about random variables on the same [[Probability Space]].
