# Motivation

A [[Topological Space]] does not necessarily have to have unique limits of sequences.

# Definition

A **Hausdorff** [[Topological Space]] is a topological space $(X, \mathcal{T}_{X})$ which satisfies :

If $z_{1}, z_{2} \in X$ and $z_{1} \neq z_{2}$, then there exists $N_{1} \in \mathcal{N}(z_{1})$, $N_{2} \in \mathcal{N}(z_{2})$ with $N_{1} \cap N_{2} = \phi$. (**Separation Axiom**)

Equivalently this means that if for any $N_{1} \in \mathcal{N}(z_{1})$ and $N_{2} \in \mathcal{N}(z_{2})$ if $N_{1} \cap N_{2} \neq \phi$ then $z_{1}=z_{2}$.
