# Motivations

Let $(X, \Sigma)$ be a [[Measurable Space]].

In probability theory, we often want to show a property holds for general [[Borel Measurable Function]] $f$.

It is almost always the case that it is easy to show the property holds for functions of the form $1_{A}(x)$ where $A \in \Sigma$. This theorem then allows us to extend this result to general measurable functions.
