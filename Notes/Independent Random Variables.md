# Characterisations

## Distribution Functions

Two [[Random Variable]] $X$ and $Y$ are independent if 
$$
F_{X,Y} (x,y) = F_{X}(x)F_{Y}(y)
$$
 
## Sigma Algebras

$X_{1}, X_{2}, \dots, X_{n}$ are independent if and only if their [[Sigma Algebra Generated by Random Variables]] are independent. This follows from [[Independence of Sigma Algebras]].
