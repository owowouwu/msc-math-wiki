# Definition

Let $\mathbb{K}$ be either $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. A sequence space is defined by the set of all sequences in $\mathbb{K}$ -
$$\mathbb{K}^\mathbb{N}=\{f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{K}\}$$
We denote the set of real sequences by
$$\mathbb{R}^\infty = \{f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\}$$
Another notational convention is
$$
\mathbb{R}^\infty = \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^{>n}
$$
where $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$

## As a Vector Space

Sequence spaces can be vector spaces with addition and scalar multiplication defined by
$$\begin{aligned}
(f+g)(\cdot)&= f(\cdot)
 + g(\cdot)\\
(cf)(\cdot)&=cf(\cdot)
 \end{aligned}
$$
