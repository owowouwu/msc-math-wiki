# Definition

A function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a **distribution** function if it satisfies the following properties

1. Montonocity - $f(x) \leq f(y)$ if $x\leq y$
2. Right continuity - $f(x^+) = \lim_{y \downarrow x} f(y) = f(x)$.
3. $f(-\infty) = 0$, $f(\infty) = 1$.

# Correspondence with Probability [[Measure]]

Any function $f$ that satisfies the above properties is a distribution function, regardless of whether or not it is related to a probability space or random variable.

However by [[Caratheodory Extension Theorem]], we can show that any distribution function can be uniquely extended to a probability measure on $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$.

## Sketch of Idea

We want to show that a set function over the [[Algebra of Sets]] $\mathcal{A}$ generated by intervals of the form $(-\infty, a]$, $(a, b]$ and $(b, \infty)$ can be defined in terms of the distribution function.

i.e define $\mu_{F} : \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that

- $\mu_{F}((-\infty, b]) = F_{X}(b)$
- $\mu_{F}((a,b]) = F_{X}(b) - F_{X}(a)$
- $\mu_{F}((a, \infty)) = 1-F_{X}(a)$

After this is done, we use [[Caratheodory Extension Theorem]] to extend this set function to the a measure on the [[Sigma Algebra]] generated by the algebra, which gives the [[Borel Sigma Algebra]].

The measure induced by this we denote as $\mu_{F}$ ([[Probability Law]]), and the [[Measurable Space]] is 
$$
(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}), \mu_{F})
$$
## Constructing Random Variables

If we want to construct a [[Random Variable]] such that $X \sim F$, we take the measurable space above and define the random variable as $X : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, X(\omega) = \omega$ . Then clearly for any Borel set $A$, $X^{-1}(A) = A \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$.
