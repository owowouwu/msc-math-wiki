Let $X$ be a set. A **uniform space** is a set $X$ with a collection $\mathcal{E}_{X}$ of subsets of $X \times X$ called a [[Uniformity]].

Uniform spaces allow us to generalise the ideas of [[Uniform Convergence]] and [[Uniformly Continuous|uniform continuity]].

While topologies have general notions of points being in a neighbourhood, uniform spaces add structure that allows us to know how "close" two points are. With a topology we do not have this, we only have a rough notion of the closeness of points to sets.
