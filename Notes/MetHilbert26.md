# Function Spaces Revisited

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_{X})$ and $(Y, \mathcal{T}_{Y})$ be [[Topological Space]] and let $\text{Map}(X,Y) = \left\{ f: X \to Y : f \text{ continuous } \right\}$. Can this be given a [[Topology]]?

[[Compact Open Topology]]
[[Path Connected]]
[[Homotopy]]
[[Homotopy Space]]
[[Based Space]]

Let $(X, x_{0})$ and $(Y, y_{0})$ be [[Based Space]]. The space of based maps is the set of maps such that $f(x_{0}) = y_{0}$. This is a subspace of $\mathrm{Map}(X,Y)$ so it has the [[Subspace Topology]] of the [[Compact Open Topology]].

We can similarly define a [[Homotopy Space]] with based spaces.
