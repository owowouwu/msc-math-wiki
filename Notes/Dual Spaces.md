## Definition

Let $V$ be a $\mathbb{K}$ vector space. The dual of $V$ is
$$V^* = \{\varphi : V\rightarrow \mathbb{K} : \varphi \text{ is a linear operator}, \|\varphi\| < \infty\}$$


### Other Properties

$V$ is **reflexive** if $V$ satisfies $(V^*)^* = V$

Let $(V, |||\cdot||_V)$ be a normed vector space. Then the dual of $V$ is
$$ V^* = B(V, K)$$
Since $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ are both complete (with the absolute value norm), $V^*$ is complete.
