# Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

## Definition 10.1

Let $S$ be a set and $f: S \to S$ be a function. The set $S$ is **finite** if and only if the following are equivalent

(a) $f$ is injective
(b) $f$ is bijective

## Theorem 10.1

$T$ has an [[Eigenvector]] of eigenvalue $\lambda$ if and only if $T - \lambda$ is not injective.

## Theorem 10.2 [[Fredholm's Theorem]]

### Using Fredholm's Theorem

Given that $T$ is a [[Bounded Compact Operator]], If we can show that $T - \lambda$ is not bijective OR not injective for some $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ then we know that it is an eigenvalue.

Let $H = \mathbb{C}[[X]]$ be the completion of $\mathbb{C}[X]$

Show that 
$$
\left\{\frac{1}{x-\lambda}: \lambda \in \mathbb{C}, \lambda \neq 0 \right\}
$$
is linearly independent in $H$.
