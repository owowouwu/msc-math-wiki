# Constructing Sequences of Independent RVs

Recall from [[AdvProb6]], [[AdvProb5]] that we define [[Product Measures]] using [[Lesbesgue Integration]].

However this may not work with infinite product measures as would be the case for a *sequence* of random variables.

How to deal with

$$
(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})) \otimes (\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))\dots
$$

The underlying sample space is $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ i.e the [[Sequence Spaces]].
