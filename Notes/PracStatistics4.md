## Explaining Variance

- measure of spread or variation
- based on the idea of the average distance from the centre of the data

variance is not in the same unit as the data, (due to squares)

so we take standard deviation as $\sqrt{ \text{variance} }$ 

variance is useful because it's additivtive
$$
\text{Var}(X+Y) = \text{Var}(X) + 2\text{Cov}(X,Y) + \text{Var}(Y)
$$
as an inner product


## Standard Error

- difficult to explain as it requires the concept of an *estimator*.

is an *estimate* for the standard deviation of an estimator, which itself is a random quantity.

estimators - RVs 
estiamtes - realisations of random variables

## A Framework for Explaining

**Context** - how does it fit into the wider context of statistics? In the general scheme of things

**Definition** - make a clear concise statement if possible, does not need to be the first thing

**Example** - a concrete example of what the thing is, a good place to start

**Simplest Access** - what is the easiest or gentlest pathway to the topic? understand the client's background
