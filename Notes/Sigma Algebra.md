### $\sigma$-algebras

An [[Algebra of Sets | algebra]] that now satisfies closure under *countable* union

- $A_1, A_2, \dots \in \mathcal{F} \implies \bigcup_i A_i \in \mathcal{F}$

and the pair $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ is called a [[Measurable Space]].

This is the fundamental object in probabiltiy theory and we call subsets of $\mathcal{F}$ *events*.
