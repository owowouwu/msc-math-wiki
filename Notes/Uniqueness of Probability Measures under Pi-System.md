# Statement

Let $\Omega$ be a set, and $\mathcal{C}$ be a $\pi$-system on $\Omega$. If $P$ and $Q$ are two set functions such that for any $A \in \mathcal{C}$
$$
P(A) = Q(A)
$$
i.e they **agree** on the $\pi$-system,

Then $P=Q$ on $\sigma(\mathcal{C})$.

This means that if we have a unique set function on a [[pi-System]] satisfying some property, and also show that it is a [[Probability Measure]], then it is also the unique measure satisfying that property on the [[Sigma Algebra]] generated by $\mathcal{C}$. 

# Proof

More or less a direct corollary of [[Dynkin's pi-lambda Theorem]].
