# Statement

Let $(H, \langle . \rangle)$ be a [[Hilbert Space]] with a [[Positive Definite Hermitian Form]] that is [[Skewlinear]], 

Then for every [[Linear Operators]] $\varphi \in H^*$, there exists $f_{\varphi} \in H$ such that
$$
\varphi(x) = \langle x, f_{\varphi} \rangle 
$$
From [[MetHilbert7#Proposition 7 1]] we have that
