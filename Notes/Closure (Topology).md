# Definition

The **closure** of $A$ in $X$ is a subset of $X$ such that

1. $\overline{A} \in \mathcal{C}_{X}$ and $A \subseteq \overline{A}$.
2. $C \in \mathcal{C}_{X}$ and $A \subseteq C$ then $\overline{A} \subseteq C$.

i.e $\overline{A}$ is the smallest closed set containing $A$.

It is also the set of all [[Close Point]] of $A$.
