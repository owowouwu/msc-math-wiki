Consider [[Pointwise Mutual Information]] of all the combinations of $a$ and $c$. This is the average of $PMI$ between all combinations of $a$ and $c$ weighted by the joint likelihood $p(a,c)$.

## Problems with MI

- is biased towards rare, possibly uninformative features
- if a feature is seen rarely it will be considered as good
- but the best features in a dataset may have low MI as they may appear much more often
