Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an [[Algebra of Sets|algebra]] over $\Omega$. Suppose $\mu : \mathcal{A}\rightarrow [0, \infty]$ is a $\sigma$-finite set function satisfying $\mu(\phi) = 0$ and countable additivity on $\mathcal{A}$.

Then there exists a unique extension of $\mu$ to a $\sigma$-finite measure on $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$.

## Motivation

- it is easy to write down set functions on algebras as algebras are much simpler objects

but how do we justify countable additivity?
