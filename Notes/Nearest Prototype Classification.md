Similar to [[Nearest Neighbour]], except we take the centroid of the instances with the same class labels.

The decision boundary in this classification is the perpendicular bisector of the two centroids.

Issues arise when the class labels don't exist in distinct clusters, the centroids may not be a good representative of the labels anymore.
