# Statement

Let $\Omega$ be a set, and $\mathcal{C}$ be a $\pi$-system on that set. Then $\lambda(\mathcal{C}) = \sigma(\mathcal{C})$.

### How to Use?

If we want to prove a property $P$ holds for all members of $\sigma(\mathcal{C})$ 

- Introduce a set class $\mathcal{H}$ to be the class of subsets of $\Omega$ satisfying $P$.
- Show that $\mathcal{C}$ is a $\pi$-system and $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{H}$.
- Show that $\mathcal{H}$ is a $\lambda$-system

Then $\mathcal{H} \supseteq \lambda(\mathcal{C}) = \sigma(\mathcal{C})$.
