# Definition

A [[Bounded Linear Operators]] $T$ on a space on a [[Hilbert Space]] if it satisfies
$$
\langle Tx, y \rangle = \langle x, Ty \rangle  
$$
for any $x,y \in H$.

## Matrices

In terms of matrices, a matrix is self adjoint if
$$
A = \overline{A}^T
$$
in the case where the matrix $A$ has only real entries,
$$
A = \overline{A}
$$
i.e the matrix is symmetric.
