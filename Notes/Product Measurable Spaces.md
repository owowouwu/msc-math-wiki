Consider the two [[Measurable Space]] $(\Omega_{1}, \mathcal{F_{1}})$ and $(\Omega_{2}, \mathcal{F_{2}})$.

Naturally the sample space of their product would be the Cartesian product
$$
\Omega = \Omega_{1} \times \Omega_{2}
$$
but what is the product [[Sigma Algebra]]? ($\mathcal{F}_{1} \times \mathcal{F}_{2}$ doesn't work)

We use the [[Product Sigma Algebra]].

## Examples

We have $\mathbb{R}^n$

$$
\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n) = \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}) \otimes \dots \otimes \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})
$$
