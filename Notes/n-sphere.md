# Definition

Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$. The $n$-sphere $(S^n, p)$ is
$$
S^n = \left\{ (x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, 
 x_{n+1}) \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} : x_{1}^2 +\dots + x_{n+1}^2 = 1 \right\} 
$$
with $p = (0,0,0,0,\dots,0,1)$.

For $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ another realisation is that
$$
S^n = \frac{\mathbb{R}_{[0,1]}^n}{\left\{ \mathbf{x} = 0 \text{ if any $x_{n} =1$ or 0} \right\} }
$$
(i.e we are "wrapping the points that are on the boundary of the n-cubes")
