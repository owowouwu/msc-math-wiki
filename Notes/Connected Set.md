# Definition

Let $(X,\mathcal{T}_{X})$ be a [[Topological Space]].

Then $X$ is connected if there does not exist a partition of $X$ with two open sets i.e there does not exist non-empty $A,B \in \mathcal{T}_{X}$ with $A \cup B = X$ and $A \cap B = \phi$.

If $A \subseteq X$ and $A$ has the [[Subspace Topology]], $A$ is **connected** if $(E, \mathcal{T}_{E})$ is connected.
