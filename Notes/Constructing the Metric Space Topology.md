# Construction

Let $(X, d_{x})$ be a [[Metric Space]].

Let $B = \left\{ B_{\varepsilon}(x) : \varepsilon >0, x \in X \right\}$.

Then the set of all unions of $B$ i.e the set of unions of $\varepsilon$-balls is the [[Metric Space Topology]] on $X$.

i.e the [[Metric Space Topology]] is the [[Generated Topology]] by $\varepsilon$-balls.
