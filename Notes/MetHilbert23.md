# Uniform Spaces as Categories

To have a category we need morphisms.

Suppose we have $(X, \mathcal{T}_{X})$, $Y$, $Z$... as [[Topological Space]]

Let $f : X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to Z$ be [[Continuous]] functions.

then $f o g : X \to Z$ is a continuous function. 

For [[Uniform Space]] we have a category by having compositions of uniformly continuous functions being uniformly continuous. **proof** - follows from definition
