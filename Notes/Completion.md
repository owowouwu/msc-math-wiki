# Definition

Let $W$ be a subspace of [[Banach Space]] $V$. The completion of $W$ is defined to be 
$$
\hat{W} = \left\{ \lim_{n \to \infty} w_{n} : (w_{1}, w_{2}, \dots) \text{ is a cauchy sequence in $W$}\right\} 
$$
in other words we extend $W$ to include the limit of Cauchy sequence so that it becomes [[Complete |complete]].
