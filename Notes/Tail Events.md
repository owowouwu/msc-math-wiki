# Definition - Random Variables

Let $X_{n}$ be a sequence of [[Independent Random Variables|independent random variables]]. A **tail event** is an event whose occurence can still be determined, i.e we can calculate the probability for, if an arbitrary large but finite initial segment of $X_{i}$ are removed. i.e
$$
P((X_{1}, X_{2}, \dots) \in A) = P((X_{M+1}, X_{M+2}, \dots) \in A)
$$
for any arbitrary $M \in \mathbb{N}$.

Tail events have the property that under [[Kolmogorov's Zero One Laws]], their probabilities can only be either $1$ or $0$.

# Equivalent Characterisations

Let $\mathcal{G}_{n} = \sigma(X_{n})$ be the [[Sigma Algebra Generated by Random Variables|sigma algebra]] generated by $X_{n}$ for a fixed $n$  and $\mathcal{F}$ be the $\sigma$ algebra generated by the $X_{n}$. A **tail event** is an event which is [[Independent]] of each **finite** subset of the RVs.
