# Definition

A set class $\mathcal{F}$ of $\Omega$ is said to be a **monotone system** if it is closed under decreasing or increasing limits of sets, i.e
$$
\begin{align}
\left\{ A_{n} \right\} \in \mathcal{F}, A_{n}\downarrow A &\implies A \in \mathcal{F}  \\
A_{n} \uparrow A &\implies A \in \mathcal{F}
\end{align}
$$
## Properties

- Any [[lambda-System]] is a monotone system, see [[AdvProbAss1]].
- If $\mathcal{F}$ is also an [[Algebra of Sets]], then it is a [[Sigma Algebra]]

The monotone system generated by an [[Algebra of Sets]] is the same as the [[Sigma Algebra]] generated by the algebra, this is the [[Monotone Class Theorem]].
