## Infinitely Often

$$
\overline{\lim_{n \to \infty}} A_{n} = \left\{ A_{n} \text{ i.o} \right\} = \bigcap_{n>0} \bigcup_{m\geq n} A_{m} 
$$

Read : **for all** $n$ **there exists** $m \geq n$ such that $A_{m}$ occurs.

## All But Finitely Often / Eventually

$$\lim\inf A_{n} = \left\{ A_{n} \text{ eventually} \right\} = \bigcup_{n>0} \bigcap_{m \geq n}A_{n} $$

Read : **there exists** $n$ such that **for all** $m \geq n$  $A_{m}$ occurs.
