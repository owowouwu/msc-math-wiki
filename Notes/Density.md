# Definition

Let $(X, \Sigma, \mu)$ be a [[Measure Space]]. We say that $\mu$ has a density $\nu$ if for any $A \in \Sigma$,
$$
\mu(A) = \int_{A} \nu(dx)
$$
If $(X, \Sigma, \mu)$ is a [[Probability Space]], then we say that $\nu$ is a probability density. In the case where $\mu$ is absolutely continuous, we can take integration with respect to the Lebesgue measure.
