# Definition

Let $(X, \mathcal{T}_{X})$ be a [[Topological Space]] space. Let $A \subseteq X$. Then $A$ is **sequentially** compact is every sequence in $A$ has a cluster point.

In other words, if $a_{1}, a_{2}, \dots$ is a sequence in $A$ then there exists $z \in A$ such that $z$ is a [[Cluster Point]] of $\left\{ a_{n} \right\}$.
