# Uniform Spaces

How do we generalise ideas of uniformity such as [[Uniform Convergence]] and [[Uniformly Continuous]] functions?

[[Uniform Space]]
[[Uniform Space Topology]]

Using these spaces we can define [[Uniformly Continuous|uniform continuity]] in a more general fashion like how we define [[Continuous]] using [[Topological Space]] and open sets.

We can also show that any [[Metric Space]] is also a uniform space using the [[Metric Space Uniformity]].
